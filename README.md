# Gina's Portofolio
Portfolio project that will be updated weekly

## Description

A portfolio of work to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time positions.

This project was build in VS Code using all technologies learned up to that point: HTML and CSS. Responsivness of the web app is a must and it is included in this portfolio.

The following steps have been taken to meet the acceptance criteria:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.

## Personal statement 

I have learned to position elements in a page and style them accordingly. I have practiced my new developing skills while creating a portfolio which I will continue to build upon as I develop further. 

The responsiveness of this application is a key element of the project. I first designed the layout for mobile, followed by adjusting it for larger screens.
